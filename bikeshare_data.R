##### Capital Bikeshare data #####

##### RQs #####

#â€¢	Which Capital Bikeshare Station pairs have the highest traffic? 
#  o	What is the most direct route between those stations?  
#  o	How long does the most direct take by bike (predicted, from OpenRouteService)? 
#  o	How long is the median most direct ride time (actuals, from Capital Bikeshare)?
#  o	Based on the predicted direct ride time and median recorded ride time, how many bicyclists are traveling directly from Station A to Station B?

#to do
# - manually clean bikeshare matching data... or come up with a matching algo that scores 100%
# - find routing data
